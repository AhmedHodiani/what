## DX Improvements (Ongoing)

### üéØ High Priority DX Wins
1. **Widget Registry Pattern** ‚úÖ COMPLETE (Medium Effort)
   - Problem: Adding widgets requires editing 3-4 files
   - Solution: Self-registering widget system with `widget-registry.ts`
   - Benefits: Add widgets without touching canvas-object.tsx, foundation for plugin system
   - Status: ‚úÖ Implemented - canvas-object.tsx reduced from 160‚Üí90 lines (56% reduction)
   - Files: `widget-registry.ts`, `register-all.ts`, updated `canvas-object.tsx`

2. **Properties Panel Registry** ‚úÖ COMPLETE (Medium Effort) 
   - Problem: Properties panels scattered across 5 files, mixed inline/separate, inconsistent patterns
   - Solution: Panel registry system with shared UI components
   - Benefits: 88% code reduction, consistent patterns, easy to add new panels
   - Status: ‚úÖ Implemented - canvas-properties-panel.tsx reduced from 313‚Üí36 lines!
   - Files: `panel-registry.ts`, `base-panel.tsx`, 5 extracted panels, `register-all.ts`

3. **Cleanup Debug Logs** ‚úÖ COMPLETE (Low Effort)
   - Problem: Production code has emoji-laden debug logs everywhere
   - Solution: Centralized logger with consola
   - Benefits: Auto dev/prod mode, consistent formatting, namespaced loggers
   - Status: ‚úÖ Implemented `src/shared/logger.ts` with tagged loggers

4. **Shared Widget Props Type** üî•üî• (Low Effort - Quick Win)
   - Problem: Every widget repeats the same 7 props
   - Solution: Shared `BaseWidgetProps` interface
   - Benefits: DRY principle, easier to add common props
   - Status: Partially done via `WidgetWrapper`, could formalize further

### üìã Medium Priority DX Improvements
5. **Object Factory Pattern** üî•üî• (Medium Effort - Week 3)
   - Problem: Object creation logic scattered across toolbar, shortcuts, paste
   - Solution: Centralized factory in `lib/factories/drawing-object-factory.ts`
   - Benefits: Single source of truth, consistent defaults, easier testing
   - Status: Planned for Week 3 with Command Pattern

6. **Typed Event System** üî• (High Effort - Week 3)
   - Problem: Prop drilling callbacks through 5+ components
   - Solution: Typed event emitter pattern
   - Benefits: Eliminates prop drilling, decouples components
   - Status: Consider if prop drilling becomes painful during Week 3

7. **Type-Safe IPC Calls** üî• (Medium Effort - Week 4)
   - Problem: IPC calls are stringly-typed, easy to make typos
   - Solution: Typed IPC wrapper with autocomplete
   - Benefits: Compile-time safety, self-documenting API
   - Status: Nice-to-have for Week 4

### üõ†Ô∏è Nice-to-Have
8. **Debug Panel Component** üî• (Low Effort)
   - Problem: Debug logs scattered, hard to track state
   - Solution: Unified debug panel with real-time state
   - Benefits: Better than console spam, easy toggle
   - Status: Low priority - logger system covers most needs
